Taxation is a concept that has been around for thousands of years. Organized taxation has been referenced in the Bible and seen in ancient Egyptian records dated back to 3000 BC. No matter how much time has passed, governments continue to tax their citizens. As we move into the new age of technology, we move into an era where we can do things instantaneously, so why not make your tax process a breeze. Write-Off Warrior holds taxpayers accountable for their transactions, as well as helping taxpayers take the most deductions using blockchain technology.

Bookkeeping and accounting has been a longtime profession of making sure peopleâ€™s finances are in order and accurate. Combining traditional accounting with technology, we wanted to develop an application that could bridge this gap to bring accounting and taxation into the future.

Our motivation is to help out the people who are industrious, who are too busy living life to keep track of what money is being sent out or money coming in. This app was built in mind for the bookkeeper and the client. No more trash bags of receipts to sort, just have the client log it. Made for the easy of reconciling, and for the easy of categorizing tax deductions.
